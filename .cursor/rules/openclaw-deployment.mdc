# LiNKbot OpenClaw Deployment Rules

You are an expert systems engineer working on **LiNKbot**, a simplified single-bot deployment using the OpenClaw framework.

## Project Context

This is **Phase 1: Single Business Partner Bot** - a simplified, production-ready deployment that prioritizes:

1. **Simplicity**: Single VPS bot using OpenClaw's battle-tested codebase
2. **Speed to Production**: Leveraging DigitalOcean 1-Click deployment
3. **Proven Infrastructure**: Building on OpenClaw's production-ready foundation
4. **Iterative Growth**: Start simple, add complexity only when needed

### Historical Context

This project is a fresh start. The previous LiNKbot implementation (archived at `/Users/linktrend/Projects/LiNKbot-Archive-2026-02-07/`) was a complex dual-bot system with:
- Custom protocol implementation
- Cloud Bot (strategic orchestrator)
- Local Bot (hardened execution node)
- Custom UI dashboard

**The archived specs in `docs/archive/specs/` are for reference/learning only.** They document the original dual-bot vision but are NOT implementation specifications for this simplified approach.

## 1. Deployment Philosophy

### Start Simple, Scale Smart

- Begin with proven solutions (OpenClaw) rather than custom implementations
- Deploy quickly to gather real-world feedback
- Add complexity only when justified by actual requirements
- Prioritize reliability and maintainability over architectural elegance

### Current Goal

Deploy a **single business partner bot** that can:
- Handle business-related conversations
- Integrate with existing systems
- Provide reliable, production-grade service
- Scale horizontally as demand grows

---

## 2. Technology Stack

### Core Platform

- **Base**: OpenClaw production codebase
- **Deployment**: DigitalOcean 1-Click OpenClaw App
- **Infrastructure**: Single VPS initially, horizontal scaling as needed
- **Customization**: Minimal, focusing on core business partner functionality

### Development Approach

- Fork or deploy OpenClaw with minimal modifications
- Focus on configuration and skill development rather than core platform changes
- Leverage OpenClaw's existing features and patterns
- Document any customizations clearly

## 4. Development Guidelines

### When Adding Features

1. **Check OpenClaw First**: Does OpenClaw already provide this functionality?
2. **Prefer Configuration**: Can this be achieved through configuration vs code changes?
3. **Skills Over Core Changes**: Implement as a skill rather than modifying core OpenClaw
4. **Document Rationale**: Clearly document why any customization is necessary

### Code Organization

- **`bots/`**: Configuration files, deployment scripts, environment configs
- **`skills/`**: Custom skills specific to business partner bot functionality
- **`docs/deployment/`**: All OpenClaw deployment documentation
- **`docs/archive/`**: Historical reference material (read-only)

### What NOT to Do

- DO NOT implement custom protocols or communication layers
- DO NOT create dual-bot architectures (we're starting with single bot)
- DO NOT build custom UI dashboards (use OpenClaw's existing interfaces)
- DO NOT add complexity without clear justification
- DO NOT reference archived specs as implementation requirements

---

## 5. Deployment Workflow

### Phase 1: Research & Planning

1. Review OpenClaw documentation and architecture
2. Identify DigitalOcean 1-Click deployment options
3. Document minimal customization needs for business partner bot
4. Plan skill development approach

### Phase 2: Initial Deployment

1. Deploy OpenClaw to DigitalOcean using 1-Click option
2. Configure for business partner bot use case
3. Test basic functionality
4. Document deployment process

### Phase 3: Customization & Skills

1. Develop business-specific skills
2. Configure bot personality and capabilities
3. Test with real business scenarios
4. Iterate based on feedback

### Phase 4: Production & Scaling

1. Production deployment
2. Monitor performance and usage
3. Scale horizontally as needed
4. Plan future enhancements based on real requirements

---

## 6. Documentation Requirements

### Mandatory Documentation

- **Deployment Steps**: Every deployment action must be documented
- **Configuration Changes**: All customizations must be tracked
- **Skill Development**: Document purpose, inputs, outputs of each skill
- **Decisions**: Architectural decisions and their rationale

### Documentation Location

- Deployment docs: `docs/deployment/`
- Skills docs: `skills/README.md` (to be created)
- Decision logs: `docs/decisions/` (to be created as needed)

---

## 7. Testing Strategy

### Before Deployment

- Verify OpenClaw installation locally (if possible)
- Test configuration changes in isolation
- Validate skills before integration

### After Deployment

- Smoke test basic bot functionality
- Test business-specific use cases
- Monitor logs for errors
- Verify scaling behavior

---

## 8. Security Considerations

### Leverage OpenClaw's Security

- Use OpenClaw's built-in authentication and authorization
- Follow OpenClaw's security best practices
- Don't weaken existing security measures

### Custom Security

- Secure any API keys and credentials
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Never commit secrets to repository
- Document security decisions

---

## 9. Scaling Plan

### Initial Deployment

- Single VPS instance
- Vertical scaling (upgrade instance size) as first option

### Horizontal Scaling

- Add additional VPS instances when vertical scaling insufficient
- Use load balancer for distribution
- Share state via database (OpenClaw's approach)

### Multi-Bot Future

- When justified by requirements, add specialized bots
- Each bot = separate OpenClaw instance
- Communication via OpenClaw's mechanisms or APIs
- Document multi-bot architecture decisions

---

## 10. Priority Hierarchy

When making decisions, follow this priority:

1. **Reliability**: Proven solutions over custom implementations
2. **Simplicity**: Minimal complexity that meets requirements
3. **Speed**: Get to production quickly to gather real feedback
4. **Scalability**: Design for growth but don't over-engineer initially

---

## 11. Prohibited Actions

### Universal Prohibitions

- DO NOT recreate the dual-bot architecture from the archive
- DO NOT use archived specs as implementation requirements
- DO NOT build custom protocol layers
- DO NOT create custom UI dashboards without clear justification
- DO NOT add dependencies without explicit need
- DO NOT commit secrets or credentials

### Development Prohibitions

- DO NOT modify OpenClaw core without understanding implications
- DO NOT bypass OpenClaw's built-in features
- DO NOT implement workarounds for problems that should be fixed upstream
- DO NOT sacrifice security for convenience

---

## 12. Getting Help

### When Stuck

1. **Check OpenClaw Documentation**: Likely answered there
2. **Review Deployment Docs**: Check `docs/deployment/` for guidance
3. **Ask for Clarification**: If unclear, stop and ask
4. **Propose Solutions**: When asking, include recommended approach

### Information Sources

- OpenClaw GitHub repository
- OpenClaw documentation
- DigitalOcean documentation
- `docs/deployment/` in this repository
- `docs/archive/specs/` for historical context only

---

## 13. Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success

- OpenClaw deployed to DigitalOcean
- Basic bot functionality operational
- Can handle business conversations
- Documented deployment process
- Clear path to customization

### Long-term Success

- Reliable, production-grade service
- Positive user feedback
- Easy to maintain and update
- Clear scaling path
- Justified complexity (every feature earns its place)

---

## End of Rules

**Remember**: This is a simplified, practical approach. Start with OpenClaw's proven foundation, deploy quickly, and iterate based on real needs.

**Philosophy**: "Start simple, scale smart" - complexity must be earned through demonstrated need, not assumed upfront.

**Historical Note**: The archived dual-bot system represents one vision. This project represents a different approach: pragmatic, production-focused, and built on proven foundations.

When in doubt: **Check OpenClaw docs first, then ask.**
