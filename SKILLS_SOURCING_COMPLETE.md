## Technology Requirements

### Gmail Integration
- **Python**: 3.10 or higher
- **Package Manager**: uv (recommended) or pip
- **Virtual Environment**: venv or uv venv
- **APIs**: Gmail API, Calendar API (optional)
- **OAuth**: Desktop app credentials
- **Storage**: ~10 MB (with dependencies)

### Calendar Integration
- **Node.js**: v20+ LTS
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Build Tool**: esbuild (included)
- **APIs**: Google Calendar API
- **OAuth**: Desktop app credentials
- **Storage**: ~20 MB (with node_modules)

### System Requirements
- **macOS**: 10.14+ (for Claude Desktop)
- **Memory**: 200 MB minimum for both skills
- **Network**: Internet connection for OAuth and API calls
- **Ports**: 3000-3004 available for OAuth callbacks

---

## API Requirements

### Google Cloud Platform
**Required APIs** (enable in console):
- ✅ Gmail API
- ✅ Google Calendar API

**OAuth Setup**:
- ✅ OAuth 2.0 credentials (Desktop app type)
- ✅ Test users added to OAuth consent screen
- ✅ Credentials JSON downloaded

**Quotas** (Free Tier):
- Gmail: 1B queries/day, 100 send/sec
- Calendar: 1M queries/day, 50 writes/sec
- **Impact**: Unlikely to hit limits with personal use

---

## Recommendations

### Primary Recommendation
**Deploy Both Downloaded Skills**:
1. Use `gmail-integration` for email operations (best context-aware analysis)
2. Use `calendar-integration` for calendar operations (best multi-account/recurring events)
3. Enable Calendar API in gmail-integration for basic event-from-email detection
4. Run both simultaneously in Claude Desktop (no conflicts)

**Rationale**:
- ✅ Specialized tools excel at their domains
- ✅ Complementary feature sets (no overlap)
- ✅ Both production-ready or near-production
- ✅ Excellent documentation for both
- ✅ Standard OAuth 2.0 (consistent auth flow)

### Alternative Recommendation
**Switch to Google Workspace MCP** if:
- Need Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides integration
- Want CLI mode for automation
- Prefer single installation for all Google services
- Need tool tiers for API quota management
